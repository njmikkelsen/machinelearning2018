The following list is an explanation of the naming conventions used by the files in this directory.

NNgridsearch1:
- The NumPy files are labelled "gridsearch1_{activation}{tag}".
  x The {activation} keyword denotes the activation function used in the neural network.
    It can take one out of the following three strings: "logistic", "tanh" or "relu"
  x The {tag} keyword is an additional integer that separates NumPy files with the same activation function.

- The image files follow the same naming convention as the NumPy files.

NNgridsearch2:
- The NumPy files are labelled "gridsearch2_{L}_{N}_{activation}{tag}".
  x The {L}          keyword denotes the number of layers used in the neural network.
  x The {N}          keyword denotes the number of nodes per layer used in the network.
  x The {activation} keyword is the same as in NNgridsearch1.
  x The {tag}        keyword is the same as in NNgridsearch1.

- The image files follow the same naming convention as the NumPy files.

NNgridsearch3:
- The NumPy files are labelled "gridsearch2_{L}_{N}_{gamma0}_{eta}_{tag}".
  x The {L}          keyword is the same as in NNgridsearch2.
  x The {N}          keyword is the same as in NNgridsearch2.
  x The {gamma0}     keyword denotes the neural network's initial learning rate.
  x The {eta}        keyword denotes the neural network's momentum strength.
  x The {activation} keyword is the same as in NNgridsearch1.
  x The {tag}        keyword is the same as in NNgridsearch1.
